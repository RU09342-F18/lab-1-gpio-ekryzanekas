This portion allows the user to take the chip off of the board and connect to the breaboard to make two LEDs blink at different
frequencies. Using the same code from the MultiBlink section, I programmed the chip. I referenced the datasheet to find the pin
assignments for each pin. I connected LEDS and a 1k resistor to pin 1.0 and 1.6 on the chip and connected the Reset and Test Pins
from the chip to the reset and test pins on the board. I connected my board to my computer to run 3.3V to the breadboard by then 
connecting GND and VCC to their respective pins. A link to a video of the setup is below:
