In this lab, the reader will be able to intrpret the code to make the LED blink on both the MSP430G2553 and the MSP430F5529LP.
The code was taken from the TI resource center. It directs the P1.0 Pin to the be output. It then runs an infinite loop and 
increments until it hits a certain number of ticks. Once it reaches that tick, it will toggle the LED and then start counting again.
The code for each boards is virtually the exact same.
